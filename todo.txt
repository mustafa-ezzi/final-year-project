================================================================================================
Communication Rules (IMPORTANT)

Before starting any task:
👉 Drop a message in the WhatsApp group saying what you’re working on

After completing work:
👉 Share update + what was done in the group

====================================================================================================
Everyone must run:

git pull origin main


Work only on your own branch

Faizan → feature/faizan   ---> branch name

Shabbir → feature/shabbir ---> branch name

Aliyan → feature/aliyan  ---> branch name

Pushing Code (Correct Way)
git add .
git commit -m "clear and meaningful message"
git push origin your-branch-name (sab apni name ki branch dalenge your-branch-name hata kr....)
